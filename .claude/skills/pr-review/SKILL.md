# PR Review

**Arguments:** $ARGUMENTS (PR number, or empty to auto-detect)

## Step 1: Identify PR

```bash
# If $ARGUMENTS is a number, use it. Otherwise auto-detect from current branch.
gh pr view ${ARGUMENTS} --json number,title,url,state,isDraft,body,baseRefName,headRefName 2>/dev/null \
  || gh pr view --json number,title,url,state,isDraft,body,baseRefName,headRefName
```

If the PR is closed or a draft, stop and tell the user.

Record: PR number, title, URL, base branch, head SHA.

```bash
git rev-parse HEAD
```

## Step 2: Fetch PR Context

```bash
gh pr diff <number>
gh pr view <number> --json files --jq '[.files[].path] | join("\n")'
```

Pass both outputs to all review agents.

## Step 3: Parallel Review

Launch **all four agents simultaneously** in a single message with four parallel Agent tool calls:

**Agent: go-reviewer**
Prompt: "Review this pull request for Go code quality and AGENTS.md compliance.
PR #<number>: <title>
Changed files: <list>
Diff:
<diff>"

**Agent: test-analyzer**
Prompt: "Review this pull request for test coverage.
PR #<number>: <title>
Changed files: <list>
Diff:
<diff>"

**Agent: security-auditor**
Prompt: "Review this pull request for Kubernetes security concerns.
PR #<number>: <title>
Changed files: <list>
Diff:
<diff>"

**Agent: go-reuse-checker**
Prompt: "Review this pull request for reimplemented functionality that already exists in the project's imports or Go stdlib.
PR #<number>: <title>
Changed files: <list>
Diff:
<diff>"

Wait for all four to complete before proceeding.

## Step 4: Aggregate and Post

Collect findings from all three agents. Only include issues with confidence >= 80.

If no issues meet the threshold, post:

```
